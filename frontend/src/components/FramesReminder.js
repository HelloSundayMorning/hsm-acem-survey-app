        <h2>Say: “As you doctor/nurse/clinician you have seen that you have significant health risks related to alcohol. This will be reduced by cutting back on your drinking.”</h2>

        <p>Emphasise that the decision to change drinking patterns or to continue drinking at the same level is the choice of the person alone.</p>

        <h2>Say: “Nobody can make this choice for you. It’s really up to you to make a change…”</h2>

        <p>Provide a menu of strategies for changing drinking behaviours. For example:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Setting personal drinking limits and sticking to it;</li>
            <li>Alternating alcoholic drinks with soft drinks;</li>
            <li>Switching to low alcohol drinks;</li>
            <li>Having regular alcohol-free days;</li>
            <li>Identifying high-risk situations for heavy drinking and creating a management plan; Engaging in alternative activities to drinking.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Say: “What is one thing you can do to reduce your risk?”</h2>

        <p>Support the person’s self-efficacy for change, and communicate a sense of optimism. De-emphasise helplessness or powerlessness.</p>

        <h2>Say: “Many people successfully control their drinking or stop drinking all together. With the right support and information I’m confident that you will do it too”.</h2>

        <p>*Please provide your patient with the Better Health Channel alcohol handout before they leave.</p>
